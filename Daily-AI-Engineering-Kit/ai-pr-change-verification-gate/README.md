# AI PR Change Verification Gate

Reusable AI engineering package for verifying pull-request changes with evidence before merge.

## Problem
AI-generated code can compile while still violating requirements, architecture, security, or regression expectations.

## Purpose
Provide a bounded workflow where agents inspect context, review changes, run deterministic checks, and produce an approval-ready verification report.

## Components
- skills: repeatable review procedures
- rules: safety constraints
- subagents: separated responsibilities
- workflows: bounded lifecycle
- hooks/scripts: deterministic validation

## Workflow
Trigger -> Gather diff/context -> Plan review -> Analyze -> Test -> Verify -> Report

## Safety
No automatic merge, production deployment, destructive migration, secret changes, or permission escalation.

## Done Criteria
- Diff reviewed
- Evidence collected
- Checks executed
- Risks documented
- Verification report generated
